# Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to support the business case by bringing bike sharing to Des Moines, IA. In order to accomplish this, an analysis was run on the New York City Citi Bike program. This analysis was conducted through NYC Citi Bike because it is a well estabilshed bike sharing program. Further analysis is below which information that can be used to help determine if starting a bikesharing program in Des Moines, IA is visable.

## Results

As you can see here these two visualizations above show the checkout durations and August hours. It shows that most bike rides are under 20 minutes in total duration where the peak hours are around the morning and evening commute hours. This could mean that the bikes are utilized for commuting to and from work.

As you can see here these two visualizations above are broken down by gender and how long each gender rides for. It shows that the bike sharing program is more utilized by men than woman. We can come to the conclusion that when marketing the bike sharing program, it should be more focused on selling to men.

As you can see here, this heatmap shows that when it comes to the customers of the bike sharing program, the genders are pretty even. Subscribers are mostly men, but general customers are more evenly split between men and women. This means there could be an opening to convert more women to be subscribers in the Des Moines, IA area.

## Summary

Des Moines, IA may have a smaller percentage of tourists than most cities, like New York City, but the usage by locals should be similar to NYC. With the right pricing structure the program should do well. In order to continue the analysis, here are my suggestions:

1. The total number of bikes can be calculated using the bike ID and then the utilization charted to extimated how many bikes are sitting idle at any one time and therefore not making any money.
2. The checkout times should be re-run using only *subscribers*. Since these are less likely to be tourists and will be more of a source of steady income for the program, this may give a more realiztic picture of what the Des Moinse program can expect to see.
